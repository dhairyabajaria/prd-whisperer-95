## 游늶 TASKS COMPLETED

### Task P1.1.3: Form Loading States Assessment - September 18, 2025, 05:45 PM UTC
**Time Spent:** 10 minutes  
**Status:** 游뚾 IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** 游리 HIGH

**Implementation Details:**
- **Files Assessed:** `client/src/pages/customers.tsx`, `finance.tsx`, `inventory.tsx`, `marketing.tsx`, `hr.tsx`, `pos.tsx`, `purchases.tsx`
- **Current State:** Basic loading states exist with text changes (e.g., "Creating..." vs "Create")
- **Issue Found:** Inconsistent visual loading indicators - only customers.tsx uses spinner icon

**Results Found:**
- **Basic Loading:** All major forms have `{mutation.isPending ? "Loading..." : "Submit"}` pattern
- **Visual Enhancement:** Only customers.tsx has `<Loader2 className="w-4 h-4 animate-spin" />` icon
- **Consistency Gap:** Other forms lack visual spinner indicators

**Next Steps:**
- Add consistent `<Loader2>` spinner icons to all form submit buttons
- Ensure uniform loading experience across all forms
