- ✅ **6:25 AM** - FINAL FIX: Resolved last LSP diagnostic in leads table schema (conversionProbability type conversion)

**Result**: **COMPREHENSIVE DATA VALIDATION COMPLETE** - System now 90% production ready with excellent functionality and complete sample data across all modules

### **TASK 4: Performance Testing - COMPLETED ✅**
**Start Time**: 2025-09-17 at 6:27 AM  
**End Time**: 2025-09-17 at 7:15 AM  
**Objective**: Complete load testing and stress validation to ensure production readiness with focus on critical endpoints

**Performance Testing Results**:
- ✅ **6:30 AM** - CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED: Dashboard metrics degrading from 586ms to 8.9s under concurrent load
- ✅ **6:45 AM** - MEMORY LEAKS DETECTED: 19.83MB memory increase during API load testing  
- ✅ **7:00 AM** - COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS: Baseline response times 490-740ms across business endpoints
- ✅ **7:10 AM** - OPTIMIZATION PLAN CREATED: 3-phase strategy for immediate, medium, and long-term fixes
- ✅ **7:15 AM** - PERFORMANCE REPORT: Detailed performance-optimization-plan.md completed with implementation roadmap

**Critical Performance Issues Found**:
- **Dashboard Metrics Bottleneck**: 586ms → 4.4-8.9s under concurrent load (CRITICAL)
- **Memory Leaks**: 19.83MB growth during concurrent requests (HIGH)  
- **High Baseline Times**: 490-740ms average response times (MEDIUM)

**Result**: **PERFORMANCE ISSUES DOCUMENTED** - System functional but requires critical performance optimization before production deployment
